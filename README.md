# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code problems. I started working on these problems as a fun way to practice algorithm questions, though I didn't do them as the questions came out

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own Python file, following the naming convention `day<number>.py`. Input files are stored in corresponding text files.

## Solutions

### Day 1

- **File**: `dayone.py`
- **Description**: Contains two main functions:
  1. `find_distance()`: Calculates the minimum total distance between pairs of numbers from two lists
  2. `find_similarity_score()`: Computes a similarity score based on the occurrence of numbers in both lists

## Notes

- Solutions are written in Python
- Each solution includes its own input file
- The code is kept simple and straightforward, focusing on solving the problems rather than optimization

## Getting Started

To run any solution:

1. Navigate to the directory
2. Run the Python file: `python day<number>.py`

## Disclaimer

These solutions were created as a learning exercise and may not be the most optimized or elegant solutions. They represent my personal approach to solving these problems.
